Dear course participants,

You are receiving this email because you took part in the course "{{< var course.title >}}", which took place on {{< var course.when-long >}} at the {{< var course.where-institution >}}.
Thank you very much for your participation!

With this email, we would kindly **ask you for your feedback**.
Your valuable feedback will help us improve future versions of this course but also other courses on related topics.
We have prepared an online survey that should not take much longer than up to **15 minutes to complete**.

The feedback survey can be accessed here: **<https://version-control-feedback.formr.org/>**.

Please use the same **personal** and **course codeword** as before, which allows us to associate your responses with the specific course that you took part in.
As a reminder, **the course codeword is `--------`** (course password will be announced during the course).
Thank you very much for your feedback!

The course materials will continue to be available on the course website at [{{< var project.site >}}]({{< var project.site >}}).
We will also continue the development on the "Version Control Book" available at [{{< var links.book >}}]({{< var links.book >}}).
Feel free to take a look at it again at any later point of your Git journey.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us directly via email.

Thank you again for your participation and feedback!

Best wishes,

Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) and the organizing team
